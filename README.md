# Technologies Used
* CSS
* HTML
* Javascript
* Node.js

# Installation
* To begin the coding, I downloaded node, and inquirer.
* Afer coding was completed, I typed "index.js" to make sure the code was working properly.

# Process
* First, I made tests for the manager, employee, engineer, and intern to see if my coding was successful.
* After testing, I made pages for each person to conduct the proper coding, so it could be dynamically shown on the page.
* Once all the pages were made, I made an html outline so the JavaScript coding could be dynamically shown.
* Then, I added CSS to the website to for finishing touches.
